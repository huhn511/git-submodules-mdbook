//! Stronghold Protected-access Memory Runtime.
//!
//! These modules contain an interface for allocating and protecting
//! the memory of secrets in Stronghold.  Data is protected from being accessed
//! outside of a limited scope. Instead it must be accessed via the
//! provided interfaces.
//!
//! Memory allocations are protected by guard pages before and after the
//! allocation, an underflow canary, and are zeroed out when freed.
