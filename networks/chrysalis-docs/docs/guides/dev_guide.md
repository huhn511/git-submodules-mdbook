# Developer guide to Chrysalis
This is a quick guide meant to help you navigate through some of the differences you will encounter while migrating to IOTA Chrysalis.

## Seed and addresses
In Chrysalis, all ternary conversions apart from PoW have been removed which results in a better, faster developer experience. Additionally, the WOTS-Signature has been replaced by a `Ed25519` signature scheme. This means that you can now use an address multiple times to send and receive coins.

With these changes, and the further adoption of industry standards, both seeds and addresses will look completely different in IOTA Chrysalis.

With the new [wallet library](../libraries/wallet.md), developers do not need to use a self-generated seed anymore. By default, the seed is created and stored in Stronghold, our in-house built security enclave. It is not possible to extract the seed from Stronghold for security purposes. Stronghold uses encrypted snapshots that can easily be backed up and securely shared between devices. These snapshots are then further secured with a password.

More information about IOTA Wallet Library is available on [Wallet docs page](https://wallet-lib.docs.iota.org) or in the [Exchange guide](exchange_guide.md), which is mainly focused on value transactions.

> Please note, it is highly recommended to NOT use online seed generators at all. The seed is the only key to the given funds.

A root of `Ed25519` signature scheme is basically a `32-byte (256-bit)` uniformly randomly generated seed based on which all private keys and corresponding addresses are generated. A seed may be represented by a string of 64 characters using `[0-9a-f]` alphabet (32 bytes encoded in hexadecimal).

Seed can be for example generated using SHA256 algorithm on some random input generated by cryptographically secure pseudo-random generator, such as [os.urandom()](https://client-lib.docs.iota.org/libraries/python/examples.html#generating-seed-and-addresses).

```

> In modern wallet implementations, such as our [wallet.rs library](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/libraries/wallet.html) and [firefly wallet](https://blog.iota.org/firefly-beta-release/), the seed is usually generated from a `seed mnemonic` (`seed phrase`), using [BIP39 standard](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039), to be better memorized/stored by humans. It is based on randomly generated list of english words and later used to generate the seed. Either way, the seed is a root for all generated private keys and addresses

[Protocol-rfc#0010](https://github.com/Wollac/protocol-rfcs/blob/mnemonic-seed/text/0010-mnemonic-ternary-seed/0010-mnemonic-ternary-seed.md)

### Address/key space
As mentioned above, IOTA 1.5 embraced some existing industry standards, which is quite obvious even during an address generation process. Specifically, [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) standard that describes an approach to _Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets_. The standard was improved by [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) lately.

These standards define a tree structure as a base for address and key space generation which is represented by a `derivation path`:
```plaintext
m / purpose / coin_type / account / change / address_index
```
* `m`: a master node (seed)
* `purpose`: constant which is {44}
* `coin_type`: a constant set for each crypto currency. IOTA = 4218, for instance.
* `account`: account index. Zero-based increasing `int`. This level splits the address/key space into independent branches (ex. user identities) which each has own set of addresses/keys
* `change`: change index which is `{0, 1}`, also known as `wallet chain`.<br />
There are two independent chain of addresses/keys. `0` is reserved for public addresses (for coin receival) and `1` is reserved for internal (also known as change) addresses to which transaction change is returned. _In comparison to IOTA 1.0, IOTA 1.5 is totally fine with address reuse, and so it is, technically speaking, totally valid to return transaction change to the same originating address. So it is up to developers whether to leverage it or not. `iota.rs` library and its sibling `wallet.rs` help with either scenario_
* `address_index`: address index. Zero-based increasing `int` that indicates an address index

As outlined, there is a quite large address/key space that is secured by a single seed.

And there are few additional interesting notes:
* Each level defines a completely different subtree (subspace) of addresses/keys and those are never mixed up
* The hierarchy is ready to "absorb" addresses/keys for many different coins at the same time (`coin_type`), and all those coins are secured by the same seed
* There may be also other `purposes` in the future however let's consider a single purpose as of now. The constant `44` stands for BIP44
* The standard was agreed upon different crypto communities, although not all `derivation path` components are always in active use. For example, `account` is not always actively leveraged across crypto space (if this is a case then there is usually `account=0` used)
* Using different `accounts` may be useful to split addresses/key into some independent spaces and it is up to developers to implement.<br />

_Please note, having many different accounts may have a negative impact on a performance while [account discovery](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki#account-discovery) phase. So if you are after using many different accounts then you may be interested in our stateful library [wallet.rs](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/libraries/wallet.html) that incorporates all business logic needed to efficiently manage independent accounts. Also our [exchange guide](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/guides/exchange_guide.html) provides some useful tips how different accounts may be leveraged._

![address_generation](assets/address_generation.svg)

So in case of IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis), the derivation path of address/key space is `[seed]/44/4218/{int}/{0,1}/{int}`:
* The levels `purpose` and `coin_type` are given
* The rest levels are up to developers to integrate, specifically `seed`, `account`, `wallet_chain` and `address_index`

[Protocol-rfc#0003](https://github.com/iotaledger/protocol-rfcs/blob/ee07797acb5940b7dbb5c3411b184ccdc6afdbb1/text/0000-ed25519-signature-scheme/0000-ed25519-signature-scheme.md)

## Messages, payload and transactions
In comparison to original IOTA 1.0, IOTA 1.5 introduced also some fundamental changes to the underlying data structures. The original concept of `transactions` and `bundles` is gone, and has been replaced by a concept of `messages` and `payloads`.

`Message` is a data structure that is actually being broadcasted in IOTA 1.5 network and represent a node (vertex) in the Tangle graph.

It can refer to up to 8 previous messages and once a message was attached to the Tangle and approved by a milestone, the Tangle structure ensures the content of the message is unaltered. Every message is referenced by a `message_id` which is based on a hash algorithm (`Blake2b256`) of binary content of the message. It also includes previous Tangle messages as its `parents` which means it is not possible to alter the given message without altering previous messages in the Tangle.

`Message` is an atomic unit that is confirmed by network as a whole.

> IOTA is no longer based on ternary. IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis) uses binary to encode and broadcast all underlying data entities

`Message` is arbitrary size (up to 35 kB) and it can hold a variable sets of information so called `payloads`. Number of payloads a single message can encapsulate is not given. Even message without any `payload` at all is completely valid and can be broadcasted. `Message` itself does not include any timestamp; a message timestamp is derived from an acceptance of the given message by the Tangle network.

`Payload` represents a layer of concern. Some payloads may change a state of the ledger (ex. `SignedTransactions`) and some may provide extra features to some specific applications and business use cases (ex. `IndexationPayload`).

There are already implemented core payloads, such as `SignedTransaction`, `MilestonePayload` and `IndexationPayload` but the message and payload definition is generic enough to incorporate any future payload(s) the community agrees upon.

Needless to say, IOTA network ensures the outer structure of message itself is valid and comply strictly with network consensus protocol, however the inner structure is very flexible, future-proof, and offer an unmatched network extensibility.

![messages_in_tangle](assets/messages_in_tangle.svg)

The current IOTA 1.5 network incorporates the following core payloads:
* `SignedTransaction`: payload that describes `UTXO` transactions that are cornerstone of value-based transfers in IOTA network. Via this payload, `message` can be also cryptographically signed
* `MilestonePayload`: payload that is emitted by Coordinator
* `IndexationPayload`: payload that enables addition of an index to the encapsulating message, as well as some arbitrary data. The given index can be later used to search the message(s)

In comparison to IOTA 1.0, a `message` itself is not directly related to IOTA address while broadcasting to IOTA 1.5 network. Such messages are referenced using `message_id`. Messages are indirectly related to IOTA addresses via `SignedTransaction` payload, specifically `UTXO` section.

[Protocol-rfc#0017](https://github.com/GalRogozinski/protocol-rfcs/blob/message/text/0017-message/0017-message.md); 
[Protocol-rfc#0018](https://github.com/luca-moser/protocol-rfcs/blob/signed-tx-payload/text/0000-transaction-payload/0000-transaction-payload.md)

## Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)
Originally, the IOTA 1.0 used an `account-based model` for tracking individual iota tokens: _each IOTA address held a number of tokens and aggregated number of tokens from all iota addresses was equal to the total supply._

In contrary, IOTA 1.5 uses `unspent transaction output` model, so called `UTXO`. It is based on an idea to track unspent amount of tokens via data structure called `output`.

Simplified analogy:
* There is 100 tokens recorded in the ledger as `Output A` and this output belongs to Alice. So **initial state of ledger**: `Output A` = 100 tokens
* Alice sends 20 tokens to Paul, 30 tokens to Linda and keeps 50 tokens at her disposal
* Her 100 tokens are recorded as `Output A` and so she has to divide (spent) tokens and create three new outputs:<br />`Output B` with 20 tokens that goes to Paul, `Output C` with 30 tokens that goes to Linda and finally `Output D` with the rest 50 tokens that she keep for herself
* **Original `Output A`** was completely spent and can't be used any more. It has been spent and so **becomes irrelevant** to ledger state
* **New state of ledger**: `Output B` = 20 tokens, `Output C` = 30 tokens and `Output D` = 50 tokens
* Total supply remains the same. Just number of outputs differs and some outputs were replaced by other outputs in the process

![utxo](assets/utxo.svg)

The key takeaway of the outlined process is the fact that each unique `output` can be spent **only once**. Once the given `output` is spent, can't be used any more and is irrelevant in regards to the ledger state.

So even if Alice still wants to keep remaining tokens at her fingertips, those tokens have to be moved to completely new `output` that can be for instance still tight to the same Alice's iota address as before.

Every `output` stores also information about an IOTA address to which it is coupled with. So addresses and tokens are indirectly coupled via `outputs`.
So basically sum of outputs and their amounts under the given address is a balance of the given address, ie. the number of tokens the given address can spend. And sum of all unspent outputs and theirs amounts is equal to the total supply.

`Outputs` are being broadcasted encapsulated in a `message` as a part of `SignedTransaction` payload.

[Protocol-rfc#0018](https://github.com/luca-moser/protocol-rfcs/blob/signed-tx-payload/text/0000-transaction-payload/0000-transaction-payload.md)

## Selected message payloads
Currently, there are two commonly used message payloads, `IndexationPayload` and `SignedTransaction` which can be combined based as needed.

[Protocol-rfc#0000](https://github.com/luca-moser/protocol-rfcs/blob/signed-tx-payload/text/0000-transaction-payload/0000-transaction-payload.md)

### IndexationPayload
`IndexationPayload` is a payload type that can be used to attach an arbitrary `data` and key `index` to a message. When this particular payload is leveraged, then a message and related data entity can be searched via key `index` in addition to a `message_id`.

### SignedTransaction
`SignedTransaction` is a payload type that is used to transfer value-based messages as `UTXO` (Unspent Transaction Output). It changes the ledger state as old `outputs` are being spent (replaced) and new `outputs` are being created.

Each `SignedTransaction` includes the following set of information:
* `inputs`: list of valid `outputs` that should be used to fund the given transaction. Outputs are uniquely referenced via previous `transaction_id` and inner `index`. At least one output has to be given with enough balance to source all `outputs` of the given message
* `outputs`: list of IOTA address(es) and related amount(s) the input `outputs` should be split among. Based on this information, new `UTXO` outputs are being created
* `unlock_blocks`: it includes a transaction signature(s) (currently based on `Ed25519` scheme) that proofs token ownership based on a valid seed

## Dust protection

Since IOTA is feeless and has the ability to send microtransactions, attackers could use this to spam the network with very low value transactions, which we call dust. To avoid this, we only allow microtransaction below 1Mi (dust) of IOTA tokens to another address if you already have at least 1Mi as a dust allowance output on that address. The number of allowed dust outputs on an address is the amount of the dust allowance outputs divided by 100,000 and rounded down, i.e. 10 outputs for each 1 Mi deposited, with a maximum of 100 dust outputs in total.

> In the UTXO model, each node in the network needs to keep track of all the currently unspent outputs. When the number of outputs becomes too large, it can cause performance and memory issues. The RFC found below proposes a new protocol rule regarding the processing of outputs where they transfer a very small amount of IOTA’s so-called dust outputs. Dust outputs are only allowed when they are backed up by a certain deposit on the receiving address. This limits the amount of dust outputs, thus making it expensive to proliferate dust. Since a receiver must make a deposit, the protocol makes receiving dust an opt-in feature.

[Protocol-rfc#0032](https://github.com/GalRogozinski/protocol-rfcs/blob/dust/text/0032-dust-protection/0032-dust-protection.md)

## Up to 8 Parents

With IOTA 1.0, you always had to reference 2 parent transactions. With Chrysalis, we introduce a more dynamic number of parent nodes where you can reference up to 8 parents. We recommend you reference at least 2 unique parents at all times for the best possible results.
