# Welcome to IOTA Documentation
Everything you need to know, if you want to work with IOTA.  Here you can learn how to setup a Node, learn more about the Tangle or use a library to include IOTA to you project.

## The new dawn of Documentation
Chrysalis (IOTA 1.5) is the biggest update to the IOTA Network in History. There ary many improvments and alot of changes to the network, the clients and also for node operators. With the time, the IOTA Founcaiton also did grow on the amount of projects, and we come with a new soultion for docs, insprired by a distributed approach. For the legacy Network (IOTA 1.0), please visit the [legacy documentation portal](https://legacy.docs.iota.org).

Each project has now a own documentation page. On this page, you can discover all our projects and get all updates.
